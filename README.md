The aim of this project is to create a website which includes all the clubs of the Sreenidhi Institute
of Science and Technology. This website is to facilitate the students and clubs of Sreenidhi.
Herewe will be providing the details of the clubs in which students will be interested and will
provide registration forms to register in a particular club. Here the students must register and login
into the website and they should choose their interested club and complete the registration and
these details will be sent to the respective clubs. The website includes all details of the club
including achievements of the club.

Websites for clubs are nothing new. But with the right features, a well-made website for school or
community groups can serve as a portal that hosts upcoming event information, membership
details, a directory, and more. This project is about sreenidhi clubs and it is a web development
project. This provides services for both students and the clubs. This helps in better communication
between students and clubs. The website consists of the static and dynamic pages where
information regarding all the clubs and the events occurred or to be occurred in the college are
included, so the interested students can join or register in any of the clubs or the events. They can
directly join into the clubs by the completion of the payment corresponding to the clubs or the
events.
The website also consists of the developer details and the contact details of the developers so that
the clubs or the students of the college can directly communicate with the developers. Any user
that is a student of the sreenidhi can register and login into the website using their credentials and
get access to the website. This website is mainly designed to make esay the work of the club
members to easily reach the students regarding their club details.
